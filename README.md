-  Happiness Ranking
-  Happiness Scores

-  Six Factors of Happiness

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Project Walk Through

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Source ###
> For this project I chose a data set off of Kaggle.com. The data set I found was on the World Hppiness Report from 2015. During this time, a bunch of statisticians got together to collect data from the 100 happiest countries. These countries were then listed in the first column (found on the screen capture below). Next these countries were divided into 10 distinct regions of the world which can then be seen in the second column. Then based on the scores received from people from each country, ranking their country from 1 to 10 (0 being unhappy, to 10 being really happy), the happiness score column, the fourth column, was created. The happiness score column made way for the happiness rank column, the third column, which  determined which country was the happiest based on its people. The happiness score and happiness rank coulmn were further broken down by statisticians into the six factors of happiness (columns 5-10). The last column on our data is the Dystopia Residual, column eleven, which statisticians used as a benchmark to measure each country to its potential dystopia.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #1: Countries and Their Happiness Ranking ###

>The first visualizaiton is a map of all the 100 countries. All of the 100 countries collected for the World Happiness Report are noted by some shade of green: the darker the green, the happier the country and thus the higher the happiness rank. Being a visual learner, I wanted to do this to better understand the data presented and how differently it could impact different parts of the world. For instance, it was surprising to see how some developed countries like Russia and China had fallen so far behind on their happiness score. With booming economies and many opportunities, I expected these countries to have happier people, however, that was not the case. Even though this map provided me with many new insights on happiness around the world I wanted to take a closer look at how happy each region is individually.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #2: Happiness Score by World Region ###
>Next, in visualization #2, I created a box and whisker plot that compared happiness score by world region. As you can see on the screen capture below, the x-axis sorts all of the 100 countries we had seen previously into world regions, in alphabetical order, while the y-axis displays the happiness scores. This visualization, apart from sorting each country into its region, also shows where most countries, of a particular region, fall into in regards of the happiness score(the boxes on the screen capture below).By doing this, it shows a sort of happiness score average per region. The reason why I decided to create this visualization was to better understand which region of the world is the happiest and based on this data, we can see that Australia/New Zealand along with North America and Western Europe are the regions with the happiest people. But, how are they so happy? What makes up their happiness?

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #3: Six Factors of Happiness and the Happiest Countries ###
> Have no fear, visualization #3 is here! With visualization #3,I took the ten happiest countries from the data, which were, once again,
determined by their happiness rank and score, and created a stacked bar graph using the six factors of happiness which each country derives its happiness from. Before looking at the happiest country on the list, side note: this visualization (screen capture below) is organized by alphabetical order, not by happiest country as you can probably tell by the differing heights across the board. Nevertheless, according to our data, Switzerland is noted as the happiest country on the list. If we go into Switzerland's statistics we see that for its happiness, Switzerland mostly relies on its fantastic economy and family structure. In fact, if you look at all top 10 countries, we notice that economy and family are the most important factors to happiness, while trust and generosity are the least important factors to happiness.
